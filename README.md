# Data-Visualization-U3
This is the final project for our Data Visualization class at CentraleSupelec. 

The CO2 emission has increased significantly in the past 300 years, primarily as the result of industrialization. However, with the implementation of United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) and people's awareness of sustainable lifestyle, there has been new trends in the CO2 emission levels around the world. Therefore, our team decided to analyze the worldwide CO2 emission throughout time by creating a visualization tool in Python. 

The dataset of research can be referred to on this link: https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-codebook.csv

If you want to utilize the tool independently, please visit the web application realized through hugging face: https://huggingface.co/spaces/asdf654/panel_dv
